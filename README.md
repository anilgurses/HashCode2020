I am believing that my fact calculation has not worked properly. There might be additional ordering system for the libraries. I will try to solve the issue at further times. Comments and issues will be appreciated. 

Hash Code 2020 problem can be found at Google Hash Code website

### Edit1:
After a little research, I found out that greedy algorithm is the best approach for the problem. I will try to implement the algorithm for the problem soon
